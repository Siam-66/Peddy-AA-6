# Project Name: Peddy 🐶

## Description
Peddy is a web application designed for pet adoption, allowing users to browse and filter different types of pets, including dogs, cats, rabbits, and birds. Users can view detailed information about each pet, such as images, prices, and other essential details, making it easier to find their ideal furry friend. The app features sorting capabilities by price and provides a seamless user experience with loading animations and category filtering, helping potential adopters make informed decisions.

## Key Features
1. **Category Filtering**: Users can easily switch between different pet categories to view specific types of pets.
2. **Loading Screen**: A user-friendly loading screen with a Cat GIF animation appears while the app fetches data from the API.
3. **Price Sorting**: Users can sort pets by their prices in descending order, allowing them to quickly find more expensive or budget-friendly options.
4. **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be responsive, providing a great user experience across different devices.
5. **Dynamic Data Fetching**: The app fetches data from a live API, ensuring that users always see the latest available pets and their details.

## ES6 Features Used
- **Arrow Functions**: Simplified function syntax for cleaner code.
- **Template Literals**: Used for string interpolation to create dynamic HTML content.
- **Destructuring Assignment**: Simplified extracting data from objects.
- **Spread Operator**: Used to create a sorted copy of the pet data array without mutating the original data.
- **Let and Const**: Used for variable declarations to ensure block-scoping and immutability where appropriate.
